== Sample App Backend

The backend code shows Couchbase Go SDK in action with Query and Search,
but also how to plug together all of the elements and build an application with Couchbase Server and the Go SDK.

Here's the Search code, where `AirportSearch` checks to see whether the search term is a three or four letter FAA or ICAO abbreviation, and if not searches for it as an airport name:

[source,golang]
----
func AirportSearch(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
	var respData jsonAirportSearchResp

	searchKey := req.FormValue("search")

	var queryStr string
	if len(searchKey) == 3 {
		queryStr = fmt.Sprintf("SELECT airportname FROM `travel-sample` WHERE faa='%s'", strings.ToUpper(searchKey))
	} else if len(searchKey) == 4 && searchKey == strings.ToUpper(searchKey) {
		queryStr = fmt.Sprintf("SELECT airportname FROM `travel-sample` WHERE icao ='%s'", searchKey)
	} else {
		queryStr = fmt.Sprintf("SELECT airportname FROM `travel-sample` WHERE airportname like '%s%%'", searchKey)
	}

	respData.Context.Add(queryStr)
	rows, err := globalCluster.Query(queryStr, nil)
	if err != nil {
		writeJsonFailure(w, 500, err)
		return
	}

	respData.Data = []jsonAirport{}
	var airport jsonAirport
	for rows.Next(&airport) {
		respData.Data = append(respData.Data, airport)
		airport = jsonAirport{}
	}

	encodeRespOrFail(w, respData)
}

== REST API

You can explore the REST API here in read-only mode, or once you are running the application, at the `/apidocs` endpoint.
